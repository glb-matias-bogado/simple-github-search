###A simple React + Redux application to search github repositories.

###Steps to run the application

- Clone this repo
- Go to the github-app folder and install the dependencies

´´´
 $ npm install
´´´

- Run the local server with the next command (be sure to not have another app runing on port 5000)


´´´
 $ npm start
´´´

- Go to http://localhost:5000 and search in github!

###Run tests

- I've made some unit tests as an example
- The application doesn't have a 100% coverage (actually is far from that)

´´´
 $ npm test
´´´
